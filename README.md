# Pong (2 Player) – Godot Engine

A local **two-player Pong** game built using the **Godot Game Engine**.  
Each player controls a paddle and competes to score points by getting the ball past the opponent.

## Engine & Tools
- Godot Engine
- GDScript
- 2D physics and collision system

## Features
- Local two-player gameplay
- Independent paddle controls for each player
- Ball movement with paddle and wall collisions
- Score tracking for both players
- Continuous real-time gameplay loop

## What I Implemented
- Two-player input handling using Godot’s input system
- Paddle and ball movement using physics bodies
- Collision detection and ball reflection logic
- Score updating and game reset after each point
- Clean scene structure separating paddles, ball, and game logic

## Controls
**Player 1**
- **W** – Move paddle up  
- **S** – Move paddle down  

**Player 2**
- **Up Arrow** – Move paddle up  
- **Down Arrow** – Move paddle down  

## How to Run
1. Install **Godot Engine**
2. Open the project folder in Godot
3. Run the main scene

## Project Purpose
This project was created to strengthen understanding of:
- Game engine workflows
- Real-time input handling
- Multiplayer logic on a single machine
- Physics-based movement and collisions
- Scene organization and scripting in Godot

## Future Improvements
- AI-controlled opponent mode
- Adjustable paddle and ball speed
- Sound effects and UI improvements
- Pause and restart menu
